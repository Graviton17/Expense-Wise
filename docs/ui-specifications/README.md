## Implementation Guidelines

### Color Usage

All components should use design system color tokens:

```css
/* Primary colors */
bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700
text-primary-600
border-primary-300

/* Semantic colors */
text-success-600  /* Approved states */
text-warning-600  /* Pending states */
text-error-600    /* Rejected states */
```

### Component Consistency

- All buttons use `shadcn/ui` Button component with consistent sizing
- Forms use enhanced Input components with validation
- Tables implement DataTable component with sorting and filtering
- Cards use consistent padding, radius, and shadow values

### Accessibility Standards

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management for dynamic content
- Color contrast ratios maintained

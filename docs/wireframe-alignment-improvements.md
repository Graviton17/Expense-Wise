# Wireframe Alignment Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to align the application structure with the provided wireframes, addressing the specific feedback from the wireframe analysis.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. ✅ Missing Component: Approval Rule Editor (Critical)

**Issue**: The approval rule editor component was missing from the admin dashboard, as identified in wireframe Image 2.

**Solution**:

- **Created**: `/src/components/dashboard/admin/approval-rule-editor.tsx`
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Manager approver settings with user selection dropdown
  - Approval sequence configuration (Sequential/Parallel radio buttons)
  - Minimum approval percentage with interactive slider (0-100%)
  - Dynamic rule creation with conditions:
    - Amount threshold with currency input
    - Category selection dropdown
    - User role selection
  - Rule editing and deletion capabilities
  - Real-time validation and form state management
  - Complete TypeScript interfaces and mock data integration

**Integration**: The component is now properly integrated into the admin dashboard using a tabs layout.

### 2. ✅ Component Rename: Expense History Table

**Issue**: The `expense-stats.tsx` component name didn't align with wireframe Image 3, which shows an expense tracking table rather than simple statistics.

**Solution**:

- **Renamed**: `expense-stats.tsx` → `expense-history-table.tsx`
- **Complete Rewrite**: The component now displays a comprehensive expense tracking table including:
  - Description, Amount, Category, Status columns
  - Date tracking and receipt count display
  - Action buttons (View, Edit, Download Receipt)
  - Proper table structure with responsive design
  - Status-based styling with color-coded badges
  - TypeScript interfaces for expense data

**Integration**: Updated in both employee dashboard and component exports.

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Dashboard Structure

**Admin Dashboard Updates**:

- Implemented tabs layout with three sections:
  - **User Management** tab (existing functionality)
  - **Approval Rules** tab (new ApprovalRuleEditor component)
  - **System Analytics** tab (placeholder for future features)
- Proper component integration with mock data
- Consistent styling and navigation

**Employee Dashboard Updates**:

- Enhanced tabs structure:
  - **Expense History** tab (using new ExpenseHistoryTable)
  - **Submit Expense** tab (ExpenseSubmissionForm)
  - **Upload Receipts** tab (ReceiptUpload)
- Improved user experience with proper tab navigation
- TypeScript integration with form data handling

### 4. ✅ Updated Component Exports

**File**: `/src/components/index.ts`

- ✅ Added: `ApprovalRuleEditor` export
- ✅ Updated: `ExpenseStats` → `ExpenseHistoryTable`
- ✅ Maintained: All existing component exports

## Wireframe Alignment Status

| Wireframe                 | Component             | Status      | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Image 2 - Admin Dashboard | User Management       | ✅ Complete | Existing functionality maintained             |
| Image 2 - Admin Dashboard | Approval Rule Editor  | ✅ Complete | **Newly implemented** with full functionality |
| Image 3 - Employee View   | Expense History Table | ✅ Complete | **Renamed and rewritten** to match wireframe  |
| Image 3 - Employee View   | Expense Submission    | ✅ Complete | Existing functionality maintained             |
